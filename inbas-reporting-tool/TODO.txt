Localization
    - Use portal language setting when available
    - Add support for language switching in the app, save language setting in cookies
Set up the Jasmine tests so that they can be run in browser and debugged
Disable fuzzy string matching in autocomplete
        - requires writing our own string matching function
Show autocomplete results as tree when appropriate
        - Try using react-bootstrap-treeview
Design some generic validation mechanism for the wizards
    Show validation errors on the corresponding fields
